# STAT-402
University of Alaska Stat 402 Scientific Sampling

## Description
Topics include sampling methods, including simple random, stratified and systematic; estimation procedures, including ratio and regression methods; special area and point sampling procedures; optimum allocation. The course included three group projects centered around estimating a paramater. My favorite project was the third [sampling project](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/STAT-402/blob/main/Coursework/Sampling%20Project%20%233/Project3Final.pdf), where we had to estimate the total number of pages in the QZ section of the Rasmussen Library. Although the stratified, systematic estimator we used was far from exotic the project was a fun hands on application of what we learned throughout the course.
